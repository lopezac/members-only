# members-only

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) Curiculum,
it was made to practice authentication with PassportJS, and the username & password
authentication.

I give users different abilities and permissions, users can sign in, and get
special abilities, when they become members entering the "membersonlyclub" secret
code, or become admin when they sign up or update it's profile.

Guests can only see messages, but can't see any profile, author, timestamp, etc.
Users can write messages, and edit, update it's profile and messages.
Users that are members, can see who is the author and timestamp of each message,
see users list, see different users profile.
Users that are admins, can delete and update all messages and users.
